This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Its purpose is to show that the [Next.js example for `useOptimistic` doesn't currently work](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#experimental-useoptimistic).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the error.
